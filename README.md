# Word2Vec model implemented from Scratch

This is a custom implementation to the word2vec model (both Skip-gram and C-Bag of Words) in raw `cupy`.

#### official Word2Vec paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781
#### The follow up paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546

## Includes the Skip gram model with brute-force softmax implementation.

The goal is to make this implementation standard and robust for gpus, and utilising parallel processing over threads.
